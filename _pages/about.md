# Moin, and welcome!

<p style="margin-top:25px;"></p>

I am a Doctoral Researcher in the PhD program [DYNAMICS](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics/phd-programme), jointly organized by the [Hertie School](https://www.hertie-school.org/) and [Humboldt University of Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en). I am also affiliated with the Hertie School as a [Research Associate](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/research/faculty-and-researchers/profile/person/koelzer).

My research lies at the intersection of comparative politics, political economy, electoral politics, and political geography. In my dissertation, supervised by Prof. Dr. Mark Kayser and Prof. Dr. Hanna Schwander, I examine how the interplay between subjective and objective forms of spatial inequality shapes political behavior. Methodologically, I specialize in quasi-experimental designs, observational data, and the use of geospatial data.

Before starting my PhD, I earned a BA and MA in Political Science at Kiel University. I also gained research experience at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, the Chair of Comparative Politics at Kiel University, the Chair of German Politics at Darmstadt University, and the Varieties of Egalitarianism project at the Cluster of Excellence Politics of Inequality in Konstanz.
