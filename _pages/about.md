# Moin, and welcome!

<p style="margin-top:25px;"></p>

I am a Doctoral Researcher in the PhD program [DYNAMICS](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics/people/doctoral-researchers2/sixth-cohort-2025-2028/julius-kolzer), jointly organized by the [Humboldt University of Berlin](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics/phd-programme) and the [Hertie School](https://www.hertie-school.org/). I am also directly affiliated with the Hertie School as a [Research Associate](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/research/faculty-and-researchers/profile/person/koelzer).

On this website, youâ€™ll find my [CV](https://juliuskoelzer.de/cv/), [publications](https://juliuskoelzer.de/publications/), [articles & blog posts](https://juliuskoelzer.de/blog/), and the [podcast](https://juliuskoelzer.de/podcast/) I produce.

My research lies at the intersection of comparative politics, political economy, electoral politics, and political geography. In my dissertation, supervised by Prof. Dr. Mark Kayser and Prof. Dr. Hanna Schwander, I examine how the interplay between subjective and objective forms of spatial inequality shapes political behavior and attitudes. Moreover, I am interested in how democracies can defend themselves against extremism. Methodologically, I specialize in quasi-experimental designs, observational data, and the use of geospatial data.

Before starting my PhD, I earned a BA and MA in Political Science at Kiel University and the University of Zurich. I previously worked as a research assistant at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, the Chair of Comparative Politics at Kiel University, the Chair of German Politics at Darmstadt University, and the Varieties of Egalitarianism project at the Cluster of Excellence Politics of Inequality in Konstanz.

I am passionate about analyzing and visualizing political phenomena and presenting them in an accessible way. Beyond academia, I thus also work as a [Data Journalist](https://www.zeit.de/autoren/K/Julius_Koelzer/index), focused on explaining political and electoral trends. In this role, I have primarily worked for the data department at Zeit Online.
